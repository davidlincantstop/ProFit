This project is about the implementation of ProFit: a 2D frequency domain fitting algorithm 
for JPRESS spectroscopy with prior knowledge

The files are written or generated under MATLAB 2010b. To run the simulation, you need MATLAB 2010b or higher versions with the addition of optimisation toolbox.
The project is currently running without converging to a reasonable minimum and is up for improvement.
